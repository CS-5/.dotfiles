# .dotfiles
A collection of my personal dotfiles. Really, these are likely no use to anyone
else, but I thought I'd leave this repo public just in case anyone was curious.
I am still new to vim, tmux, and fish.. so lots of what is here could probably
be far more functional. 


## Usage
This repository is structured to work with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), usage is simple.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/CS-5/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
2. Enter the directory, decide what files you want to use: `cd ~/.dotfiles`
3. Use the `stow` command for the appropriate files: `stow nvim`, `stow tmux`
~~4. Give me reccomendations for how to better use and configure vim and tmux!~~
